# haemodialysis_haemoglobin
A research code repository that aims to:

    To determine the haemoglobin concentration difference before and after haemodialysis in anaemic and non-anaemic patients.
    To correlate the haemoglobin concentration difference with fluid status, measured by weight change, before and after haemodialysis.
    To determine whether the timing of haemoglobin measurement relative to haemodialysis influences the dose of erythropoietin given to manage anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease
